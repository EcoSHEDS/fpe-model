# Flow Photo Explorer Deep Learning Model

An [EcoSHEDS](https://www.usgs.gov/apps/ecosheds/) Project

:bangbang: **WARNING**: this repo is under heavy development. Use at your own risk.

## Background

This repo contains the source code for a deep learning model designed to estimate streamflow (or other hydrologic metrics) using timelapse imagery. This model will ultimately be integrated in the [EcoSHEDS Flow Photo Explorer](https://www.usgs.gov/apps/ecosheds/fpe/).

Original development of this model was completed by Amrita Gupta and Tony Chang at [Conservation Science Partners Inc](https://www.csp-inc.org/) with funding from the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Geographic Society. See the following paper for more information:

(2022). *Towards Continuous Streamflow Monitoring with Time-Lapse Cameras and Deep Learning.* In ACM SIGCAS/SIGCHI Conference on Computing and Sustainable Societies (COMPASS) (COMPASS '22). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 353â€“363. https://doi.org/10.1145/3530190.3534805

## Python Environment

Create conda environment

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate conda environment and start Jupyter Lab

```sh
conda activate fpe-model
jupyter lab
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8888

## Datasets

Each dataset (flow and images) should be saved to `data/<site name>`. Within each site folder, there should be an `images/` folder containing the flow photos in `JPG` format and a `CSV` file called `images.csv` containing columns `filename`, `timestamp`, and `flow_cfs`.

## Development Notebooks

The `dev` folder contains a number of notebooks used during model development.

## Train Model

The regression model code is contained within the `fpe-regression.py` file. A similar file for the ranking model will soon be developed.

The `fpe-regression.py` file contains code for training the FPE PyTorch regression model. This file is designed to be uploaded to sagemaker, which trains the model using data stored in an S3 bucket. However, it can also be run locally at the command line.

This workflow was developed based on the MNIST tutorial: https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/main/sagemaker-python-sdk/pytorch_mnist

An application of the model is provided in `regression-parkers_brook.ipynb`.
